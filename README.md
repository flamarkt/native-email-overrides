# Native Email Overrides

Replaces Flarum core emails with the Flamarkt mail template.

Emails affected:

- Activate Account.
- Confirm Email Change.
- Reset Password.

You should not remove the `{url}` part of the original translations as they are used to detect the original emails and intercept them.
